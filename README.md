# Phrase-Guesser
The program will select a phrase at random and will display it as underscore placeholders  _ _ _ _ similar to the children's game hangman.
The user will guess the letters.
If correct, the letter will be displayed instead of an underscore.
The user wins if they are able to guess all the letters within the given amount of guesses.
They will lose if they run out of guesses and the phrase is not found.
